# 🤖 AI Web Content Optimizer

**AI Web Content Optimizer** is a frontend project I built to showcase how artificial intelligence can automate web performance, SEO, accessibility, and UX audits.

> 💡 Inspired by my real experience optimizing 100+ PayPal web pages during my 3 years at eClerx.  
> This project automates the manual analysis process that used to take hours — now done in minutes.
